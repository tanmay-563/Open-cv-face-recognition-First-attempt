# Real Time Face Recognition (OpenCV)

Create a fast real-time face recognition app with Python and OpenCV.


## 🧩 Features
- Detects and recognizes faces in real-time using webcam feed.  
- Captures and stores new user face images automatically.  
- Trains an OpenCV face recognizer (`LBPHFaceRecognizer`) from collected data.  
- Uses Haar Cascade classifier for face detection.  
- Displays recognition confidence and labels dynamically.  
- Fully customizable via `settings.py`.  

## Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Required packages:
- opencv-python
- opencv-contrib-python
- pillow
- pyyaml

## Configuration

All settings are stored in `src/settings/settings.py`:
- Camera settings (resolution, device index)
- Face detection parameters
- Training parameters
- File paths
- Confidence threshold (how confident the model has to be to recognize a face)

You can modify these settings without changing the code.

## Usage

The system works in three steps:

### 1. Capture Face Data
Run `face_taker.py` to capture training images:
```bash
python src/face_taker.py
```
- Enter your name when prompted
- :rotating_light: The script captures 120 images of your face. Make sure to have a good lighting and move your head around to capture different angles.
- Keep your face centered in the frame
- Images are saved in the `images` folder
- Your name and ID are stored in `names.json`
- Press 'ESC' to exit early

Format of `names.json`:
```json
{
    "1": "Joe",
    "2": "Jane"
}
```

### 2. Train the Model
Run `face_train.py` to create the recognition model:
```bash
python src/face_trainer.py
```
- Processes all images in the `images` folder
- Creates a trained model file `trainer.yml`
- Shows number of faces trained

Note: Training images are saved as: `Users-{id}-{number}.jpg`
### 3. Run Face Recognition
Run `face_recognizer.py` to start real-time recognition:
```bash
python src/face_recognizer.py
```
- Your webcam will open and start recording
- Recognizes faces in real-time
- Shows name and confidence level
- Press 'ESC' to exit
